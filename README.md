## Description


> The Camelcamelcamel Clone website will allow registered users to engage in online tracking of item prices over time from online retailers at different stores by entering and tracking items for given times and locations. 

> Unregistered users will be able to view general price trends.  The goal is to produce a service that will allow users to track item prices, set alerts, notifications and comment on items. Functionality must exist for searching/categorizing items. Additionally, unregistered users must be able to view item prices but not see the details of items.

> The administrator can manage user information and posts and may change data about items.

> Visit the site we tried to clone code to get a better idea of the overall functionality.
